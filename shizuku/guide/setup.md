3. Enter `adb`, if success, you can see a long list of content instead of the prompt not finding adb.

::: tip
Please do not close this window. The "terminal" mentioned later refers to this window (if you closed the window, please go back to step 2)

#### 3.1. MIUI device

_"It's 2019, garbage MIUI still breaks Android features."_

If you use MIUI, you also need to enable "USB Debug (Security options)".

If you use MIUI 11, MIUI 11 breaks custom permission (user apps cannot request for custom permission, please refer [this issue](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/issues/45) and [this issue](https://github.com/android-in-china/Compatibility/issues/16)), so you must grant permission for user apps in Shizuku app.

### 4. Start Shizuku

::: danger
This step needs to be re-executed each time the device is rebooted.
:::

Enter `adb shell sh /sdcard/Android/data/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/files/start.sh` in the terminal. If there is no problem, you will see that Shizuku has started successfully in Shizuku app.

### 5. How to avoid Shizuku stop (even if there is no restart)

::: danger
Please follow the rules below, otherwise it will be stopped.
:::

1. Do not turn off "USB Debugging"
2. Do not modify the USB usage mode after connecting the device to the computer (or change to "charge only" if not)

   After a security patch, if the USB usage mode is not "charge only", changing the USB usage mode will kill all processes of adb. **Therefore, be sure not to modify the USB usage mode after change to "charge only".** (This step may not be needed if your device has not received security patchs for a long time)

   In addition, some manufacturers (such as Sony) added a dialog that will modify the USB usage mode when the computer is connected. Please don't click any dialog before disconnecting.
